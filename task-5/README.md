React and react-hook-form were used to create the user-friendly and accessible Contact Form component. Users can send a message and their contact details using this form. In order to guarantee data integrity, it has built-in validation. Additionally, users can report any problems in the form fields. The form has a contemporary user interface (UI) with a responsive layout and unambiguous error notifications.
